geneference aims to ...

In this vignette, we show an example of how one might go about conducting a simulation study relying solely on the functionalities implemented in geneference.

## Simulation
We start out by simulating a dataset of x genotypes, each having y SNPs.


As we will see in the next part, geneference relies on PLINK for efficient computation of  ... . This also means that we use their fileformats.

## Analysis

An overview of expected running times can be seen in INSERT VIGNETTE.
